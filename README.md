## Future Vision

- Next Features :
  We will be adding features like auto detect zcash txns and mark the invoice paid automatically. Develop a dashboard to manage all invoices and client payments seamlessly.
- Roadmap and MVP :
  Further we want users to be able auto-convert ZEC and receive stablecoins (or any token) using Near Intents on any chain. Also we want to integrate off-ramp solutions directly into ZECPay.
- Goal and Vision :
  Our goal is to establish ZECPay as the go-to platform for creating and managing crypto invoices Provide a seamless, private, and secure payment experience.
